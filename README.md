# microBASIC
like Tiny BASIC but smaller  
I'm building this to learn how compilers work and eventually stuff like TVM and Tinygrad.  
This is a source to source compiler that takes in Tiny BASIC like code and compiles it to python and executes it.  
The syntax for microBASIC code is pretty self explanatory and I'll add stuff like if statements, loops and functions later. 
As of now, this is the bare minimum version with no type checking, no syntax checking, nothing that makes this a proper compiler but hopefully it will be soon :)
